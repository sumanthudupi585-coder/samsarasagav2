# You'll need to add this environment as a remote or manually transfer the files

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## 3. Alternative: Manual Upload

If you prefer, you can download the modified files and upload them manually to GitHub:

1. Download all the new and modified files
2. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/sumanthudupi585-coder/samsarasagav2
